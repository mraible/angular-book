Book Abstract:

The Angular Mini-Book is a guide to getting started with Angular. You'll learn how to develop a bare-bones application, test it, and deploy it. Then you'll move on to adding Bootstrap, Angular Material, continuous integration, and authentication. Spring Boot is a popular framework for building REST APIs. You'll learn how to integrate Angular with Spring Boot and use security best practices like HTTPS and a content security policy.

This initial edition (v1.0) uses Angular 12 and Spring Boot 2.5. I do plan on updating it for Angular 13 and Spring Boot 2.6. If you have any tips for upgrading, please let me know!

Purpose of the book:

I think building web and mobile applications with Angular, Bootstrap, and Spring Boot is a great experience. I'd like to encourage more developers to try it.

Back Cover:

Angular is a web framework that helps you build web, mobile web, native mobile, and desktop applications. Angular apps are authored in TypeScript, compile to JavaScript, and run in browser-based runtimes that have become fast and efficient over the last decade.

Like Struts in the early 2000s and Rails in the mid-2000s, Angular and other JavaScript frameworks have changed the way developers write applications. Today, data is exposed via REST APIs and UIs are written in JavaScript (or TypeScript).

As a Java web developer, I was immediately attracted to AngularJS when I saw its separation of concerns: controllers, services, and directives for data manipulation. Then along came Angular 2.0 in 2016 and changed everything. The team adopted TypeScript as Angular's default language, refined its architecture for the future, and created awesome tools like the Angular CLI.

It worked! The Angular project is still going strong five years later.

This book shows you how to build apps with Angular and guides you through many tools, techniques, security best practices, and production deployment options.
