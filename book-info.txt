Book Abstract:

The Angular Mini-Book is a guide to getting started with Angular. You'll learn how to develop a bare-bones application, test it, and deploy it. Then you'll move on to adding Bootstrap, Angular Material, continuous integration, and authentication. Spring Boot is a popular framework for building REST APIs. You'll learn how to integrate Angular with Spring Boot and use security best practices like HTTPS and a content security policy.

This initial edition (v1.0) uses Angular 12 and Spring Boot 2.5. I do plan on updating it for Angular 13 and Spring Boot 2.6. If you have any tips for upgrading, please let me know!

Purpose of the book:

I think building web and mobile applications with Angular, Bootstrap, and Spring Boot is a great experience. I'd like to encourage more developers to try it.

Back Cover:

Building an app with web technologies can be scary if you've never done it before. Should you use plain ol' JavaScript with jQuery or a full-featured framework like Angular? Angular com

The things you need to do to set up a new software project can be daunting. First, you have to select the back-end framework to create your API, choose your database, set up security, and choose your build tool. Then you have to choose the tools to create your front end: select a UI framework, configure a build tool, set up Sass processing, configure your browser to auto-refresh when you make changes, and configure the client and server so they work in unison. If you‚Äôre building a new application using Spring Boot and Angular, you can save days by using JHipster.

JHipster generates a complete and modern web app, unifying:

* A high-performance and robust Java stack on the server side with Spring Boot
* A sleek, modern, mobile-first front-end with Angular and Bootstrap
* A robust microservice architecture with the JHipster Registry, Netflix OSS, the ELK stack, and Docker
* A powerful workflow to build your application with Yeoman, Webpack, and Maven/Gradle

JHipster is a treasure trove of information of how to build modern web applications and microservice architectures. It can turn any curious and willing developer into a Java Hipster!
