= Action!

I hope you've enjoyed learning how Angular can help you develop secure web applications! It's a fantastic open source project that's changed my life as a UI developer. Writing testable MVC code with TypeScript is much easier to maintain than the glob of jQuery code I used to write.

I encourage you to follow the https://blog.angular.io[Angular Blog] and https://twitter.com/angular[@angular] on Twitter.

Now that you've learned how to use Angular, Bootstrap, Spring Boot, and a bit of Kotlin, go forth and develop amazing applications!

I wrote https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/jhipster-mini-book[_The JHipster Mini-Book_] (InfoQ, March 2023). JHipster automates the generation of Angular + Spring Boot apps with best practices and security baked in by default!
