= Dedication

I dedicate this book to my partner, Trish McGinity. She's taught me to love, laugh, and get outdoors more. Since I met her in 2010, I've rekindled my relationship with the great outdoors via whitewater rafting, mountain biking, and skiing.

Trish, your sweet smile and giddyup attitude make me wanna raft, ride, and ski with you as often as possible.

I love you, sweetheart!
